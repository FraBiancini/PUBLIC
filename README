# Local Volatility Model â€“ Group 12

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation, calibration, and pricing results of a **Local Volatility Model (LVM)** as part of the Mathematical Finance II coursework for Group 12 alongside Davide Matteo Bottinelli (@FitBonsai) and Salvatore Ippolito (@salvatoreippolito). 

The project focuses on:

- Calibration of local volatility surfaces from market data
- Pricing of European options via Dupire PDE and Monte Carlo simulation
- Pricing of forward starting options
- Smile and skew analysis
- Calibration challenges for ill-behaved assets
- Pricing exotic derivatives on FX with Local Volatility vs Black-Scholes models
