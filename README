This project analyzes the economic determinants of U.S. military spending using a multiple linear regression model. After careful covariate selection via AIC and model assumption checks, the most significant variables are identified, addressing issues such as multicollinearity and overfitting. The final model is validated through cross-validation and tested on recent data (2010â€“2020). The analysis also includes economic interpretations and historical insights on influential data points.
